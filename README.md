- 👋 Hi, I’m @JS, a fluids mechanics and heat transfer researcher.
- 👀 I’m interested in multiple subjects, but my major interest and expertise lies on Energy.
- 🐍 Regarding programming I started learning Python as a hobby and prospect to enhance my research work.
- 📚 Yet, I end up studing more generic concepts as data structures, OOP, SOLID principles, Architecture.
- ✨ I am since some time studying and testing PINNs mostly for solving Energy related problems.
- 📈 AI LLMs are my daily partner for productivity, wich lead to unplaned focus on tune up Agents with different Learning methods and RAG for handling my research data.
- 💞️ I’m always looking to cooperate on novel concepts.
