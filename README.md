# Hi, I'm João Soares 👋

## About Me
I'm a researcher specializing in fluid mechanics and heat transfer, with a focus on energy systems (particularly renewable energy technologies).

## Programming Journey
I started learning Python as a hobby to enhance my research work. This journey led me to explore broader software development concepts like data structures, object-oriented programming (OOP), SOLID principles, and software architecture, which I now apply to improve my coding practices.

## Machine Learning & AI in Research
For some time now, I have been integrating machine learning into my research. In particular, I'm exploring Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a novel approach to solving energy-related problems. I also use AI language models (LLMs) daily to boost my productivity. This has sparked an interest in fine-tuning AI agents using various learning methods and employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to better manage and analyze my research data.

## Collaboration & Contact

I'm always open to collaborating on novel and innovative projects. Feel free to reach out via email (📫 joaosoares@fe.up.pt or joaosoarex@gmail.com) if you'd like to discuss ideas or work together. You can also learn more about my research contributions on my ORCID profile.
